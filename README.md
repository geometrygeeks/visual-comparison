### Development

Help welcome! This is an ongoing project. All contributors (of code, issues, or coffee) get early preview access to this visualisation on [geometrygeeks.com](https://geometrygeeks.com). Hit up david at geometrygeeks dot bike for a sneak peek.

If you are writing code, this project uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).
Installation instructions here: [https://webpack.js.org/guides/installation/](https://webpack.js.org/guides/installation/).

After installation two commands are available:

- `npm run dev` - which builds/bundles the project, runs a development server, and hot reloads.
- `npm run build` - which just bundles the project.
